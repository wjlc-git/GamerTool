# GamerTool
Auto-clicker, and crosshair maker made with nothing but python, with a tkinter design. It's made to be a very simple crosshair X clone. 

# Usage:
F8 toggles the crosshair overlay on/off.
F9 toggles the auto-clicker on/off.
Customize crosshair size, thickness, color, and animations in the “Crosshair” tab.
Customize auto-clicker delay and button in the “Auto-Clicker” tab. 

# Issues
The tool overall is pretty laggy, and it updates very slowly, also the delay isnt an input its a draggable bar, lower the faster, higher the slower.
